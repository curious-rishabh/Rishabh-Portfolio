## Introduction

Portfolio in React JS which uses 3D graphics and animations to bring the content into life. The website is divided into several main sections, including an about, education, project, connect and contact section. Each section is designed to showcase 3D's unique style and creativity, with an emphasis on interactivity and user engagement.

My personal portfolio <a href="https://curious-rishabh.tech" target="_blank">curious-rishabh.tech</a> which features some of my github projects, education as well as my resume and technical skills.<br/>
